I am a second-year PhD student in Political Science at Columbia University. 

My research interests lie in international political economy, particularly in the politics of finance and trade. 

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2022, where I studied Political Science and French in the honors program.I previously worked as a predoctoral fellow at Yale University (2022-2024).
