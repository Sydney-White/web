I am a first-year PhD student in Political Science at Columbia University. 

My research interests lie in international political economy, particularly in examining the political effects of financial crises and financialization in advanced economies. I became interested in financial history, financialization, and international political economy more broadly after I spent two summers working in finance as an undergraduate. 

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2022, where I studied political science and French in the honors program.

I previously worked as a predoctoral fellow at Yale University (2022-2024). Since 2022, I have helped to administer the [International Political Economy Society (IPES)](https://www.internationalpoliticaleconomysociety.org/).
