I am a first-year PhD student in Political Science at Columbia University. I previously worked as a predoctoral fellow at Yale University (2022-2024). Broadly, I am interested in (contemporary and historical) international political economy, particularly in regard to the impact of financial crises and financialization on politics in developed countries.

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2022, where I studied political science and French in the honors program.

Since 2022, I have helped to administer the International Political Economy Society (IPES), which is currently located out of Yale University.
