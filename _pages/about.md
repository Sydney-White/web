I am a second-year PhD student in Political Science at Columbia University. 

I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2022. I previously worked as a predoctoral fellow at Yale University (2022-2024).

My research interests lie in comparative and international political economy, particularly in the politics of finance and trade. My research is generously funded by the Center for Political Economy at Columbia. 

**Working Papers:**

“Market Power and Distorted Democracy in the Progressive Era” (Kenneth Scheve, Theo Serlin, Sydney White)
