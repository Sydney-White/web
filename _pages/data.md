### Historical Dataset on U.S. Governors  

In collaboration with researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle, I have published *A Historical Dataset on Governors of the United States and Its Territories* (Sydney White, Theo Serlin, Neel Gupta, and Kenneth Scheve, September 2025). This dataset compiles information on the biographical backgrounds of governors of U.S. states and territories from 1775 to the present. It is accessible through [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/gubernatorial-bios/) and will also be archived on the Harvard Dataverse for long-term access. As co-authors and I will not be using this data, we would like to make it available for public use.

### Furnace-Level Dataset of Iron and Steel Production, 1880–1916  

The *Furnace-Level Dataset of Iron and Steel Production, 1880–1916* draws on records collected by the American Iron and Steel Association (AISA) and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). It provides detailed information on the size and output of iron and steel furnaces in the United States during the Second Industrial Revolution, including year of operation, furnace name, firm owner, location (county/city and state), and total production capacity in gross tons. Production capacity is aggregated across iron and steel products to capture broad industry concentration, enabling analysis of how market power in these industries influenced political outcomes.
