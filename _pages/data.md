Furnace-Level Dataset of Iron and Steel Production, 1880-1916

The Furnace-Level Dataset of Iron and Steel Production, 1880-1916 consists of data, collected by the \textit{American Iron and Steel Association }(AISA) and the \textit{American Iron and Steel Institute} (AISI), on the size of iron and steel furnaces in the United States during the Second Industrial Revolution. It includes details such as the year of operation, furnace name, firm owner, location of the firm (county/city and state), and the total production capacity of the furnace in gross tons. We combine production capacity across steel and iron products in order to measure broad industry concentration relevant for studying the impact of market power in the steel and iron industry on political outcomes.
